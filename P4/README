Our server handles concurrent games and the extra credit.

To test, we ran multiple games to make sure that everything was accounted for. This included a normal match between
two players, having multiple games simultaneously, and disconnecting and reconnecting to games. We made sure that
more than one game could be played at once and it could handle people disconnecting and reconnecting. We also
tested the common error codes, such as trying to play while not in a game, having too long of a name
trying to play out of turn, taking too much from a pile, and taking from a pile that doesn't exist.

tests.c also tests these errors and makes sure the socket is actually working, and can be ran with:
./tests <host> <port>
after the main server is started
